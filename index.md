    <td>How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS</td>
    <td>Someone who is empowered about the digital world can help those who are not by advising, and teaching their knowledge they have learned through their experiences with digital content. At Del Norte a club could be formed for advising about the digital world and those who are more experienced can teach and pass their knowledge onto others. Writing an article or having a podcast is also possible and can be more accessible for students who might not want to join a club.</td>

    <td>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</td>
    <td>Dopamine is a hormone which is released when someone does an activity that they feel pleasure from. Even though dopamine is good for us as humans, some people become addicted to the feeling and begin to only do the activities which they get dopamine from. As said in the notes some people begin to forget about their responsibilities outside of the activity that makes them happy which leads them to fall behind in certain aspects of life. Nothing is impacting my success right now, as I feel that I am preforming to my full extent in all my classes so far.</td>

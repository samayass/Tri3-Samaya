    <td>The owner of the computer does not think this was intentional since he was cleary joking around showing the difference the computer had with him and his coworker standing before the camera. I think this happened because the people who were coding this program were first just trying to get it to work on anyone, and they did not really think that they would have to change anything in the code for it to work on all different types of people. This was not harmful as it was not intentional and the people programming this code could not forsee that something like this could have happened. Yes it should be corrected as this was 10 years ago and now we have better technology and being able to crrect it will allow a more diverse group of people to purchase this product. I would do user testing on a more diverse group of people to ensure that there is little to no problems with the program.</td>

    <td>Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.</td>

  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?</td>
    <td>PII can be dangerous especially when it is easily accessible to anyone with internet. Most of my PII is not on the internet all that is, is my full name and my email address. My exposure on the internet is not much, but good so that someone who would need to find my information could do so.   </td>

    <td>Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.</td>
    <td>Passwords are essential to ensure security and protection of our personal information and data. There are key differences between good and bad passwords. Good passwords are ones that are random, complex and contain an assortment of characters, numbers, and symbols. Bad passwords are one that are easily guessable and ones that are complete words which are predictable. Another way to assist in authentication is to ask for the users email or phone number to send them a code for them to type in to ensure that it really is the actual user.</td>

    <td>When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages </td>
    <td>We are using GNU General Public License v3.0. <br>
       * This license allows us to have freedom with our coding and others are allowed to also have access to our free software. <br>
       * The conditions of this license are that contributors provide an express grant of patent. <br>
       * You are allowed to sell your software but there is no protection as it is open software.</td>

    <tr>
    <td>Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.</td>
    <td>We chose this license because we are not looking to make a profit off of this website and anyone should be able to use the software that we are coding in this class. People who are more experienced in this area should be allowed to build off out code and enhance it more.</td>

   </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?</td>
    <td>A crowdsource idea to initiate into the enviornment would be to have a survey taken by all the CompSciP students and see who has prior coding experience to ensure that they are distributed evenly throughout the classes, so that the groups that are going to be formed are fair.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?</td>
    <td>Yes our final project can be better with crowdsourcing as it can give us different users' input about our website, and it can show us how to implement differnet ideas to ensure that we can gauge to various people. </td>

## 5.3 - Computing Bias
<table>
   <tr>
    <th>Questions</th>
    <th>Answers</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify you conclusion. How do you think this happened? Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected? What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?</td>
    <td>The owner of the computer does not think this was intentional since he was cleary joking around showing the difference the computer had with him and his coworker standing before the camera. I think this happened because the people who were coding this program were first just trying to get it to work on anyone, and they did not really think that they would have to change anything in the code for it to work on all different types of people. This was not harmful as it was not intentional and the people programming this code could not forsee that something like this could have happened. Yes it should be corrected as this was 10 years ago and now we have better technology and being able to crrect it will allow a more diverse group of people to purchase this product. I would do user testing on a more diverse group of people to ensure that there is little to no problems with the program.</td>

    <td>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?</td>
    <td>Empowerment about the digital world can be learned when someone takes the time to reasearch about the topic and look into information which can help them become more efficient with digital content. Empowerment in the digital world can be taught but one can only learn as much as they want to, each person will have to put in their own effort to try to learn enough about the enviornment so they can become more efficient. </td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS</td>
    <td>Someone who is empowered about the digital world can help those who are not by advising, and teaching their knowledge they have learned through their experiences with digital content. At Del Norte a club could be formed for advising about the digital world and those who are more experienced can teach and pass their knowledge onto others. Writing an article or having a podcast is also possible and can be more accessible for students who might not want to join a club.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?</td>
    <td>Financialbarriers and home life can also stop someone from becoming digitally empowered as it can be difficult for some people to have access to technology.</td>

   <tr>
    <td>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing</td>
    <td>The benefits of computing is that the computer makes the work being done more efficient, allows for easier access to information, and the ability to store information easier. The harmful effects of computing is that it can be addicting and can effect a persons life in a negative way. There can be cyber security problems with peoples personal information being leaked, and another disadvantage is that too much time spent computing can lead to a dependancy which can limit the learning being done. </td>

    <td>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</td>
    <td>Dopamine is a hormone which is released when someone does an activity that they feel pleasure from. Even though dopamine is good for us as humans, some people become addicted to the feeling and begin to only do the activities which they get dopamine from. As said in the notes some people begin to forget about their responsibilities outside of the activity that makes them happy which leads them to fall behind in certain aspects of life. Nothing is impacting my success right now, as I feel that I am preforming to my full extent in all my classes so far.</td>
